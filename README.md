# Pyradar

 Pyradar is a library offering functions to communicate with QRadar APIs.

 All the functions are **blocking** for ease of implementation.

## Usage

 Create a `.env` file under the pyradar folder with the following information:

 ```env
 SEC=<api_token_here>
 API_URL=https://<qradar_api_here>/api
 ```
